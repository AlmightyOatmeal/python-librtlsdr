**** WARNING: These bindings are several years out of date.  The librtlsdr library has almost certainly chained it's API enough to make them broken out of the box.


Some simple ctypes python bindings for librtlsdr

First, get and install librtlsdr from http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr

This does nothing but wrap librtlsdr

librtlsdr.so should be in your library path. It's a good idea if you
make sure that the rtlsdr binary that comes with it works before you
try this.

I haven't tested this with windows. Theoretically it should work with
librtlsdr compiled as a DLL
